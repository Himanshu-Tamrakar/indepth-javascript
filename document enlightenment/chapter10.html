    <p class='topic'>Using defer to Defer the Downloading and Execution of External JavaScript</p>
    <div>The
        script element has an attribute called defer that will defer the blocking, down‐
        loading, and execution of an external JavaScript file until the browser has parsed the
        closing html node

    <ul>
        <li>
            Scripts are fetched asynchronously and
            executed after the HTML is completely
            parsed
        </li>
        <li>DOMContentLoaded event fires after
            defer script is executed</li>
        <li>Scripts are executed in orde</li>
        <li>This is overall the best solution! Use for
            your own scripts, and when order matters
            (e.g. including a library)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class='topic'>Using async to Asynchronously Download and Execute External JavaScript Files</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scripts are fetched asynchronously and
            executed immediately</li>
        <li>Usually the DOMContentLoaded event
            waits for all scripts to execute, except for
            async scripts. So, DOMContentLoaded
            does not wait for an async script</li>
        <li>Scripts not guaranteed to execute in order</li>
        <li>Use for 3rd-party scripts where order
            doesn’t matter (e.g. Google Analytics)</li>
